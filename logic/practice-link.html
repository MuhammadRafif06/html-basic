            Bun (and before you ask yes all the cool names have already been taken ðŸ˜… ) is a new open source runtime
            environment created by Jared Sumner and over 40 contributors. This nerdy looking runtime environment really
            packs a punch.The war among frameworks is a hot topic in the JavaScript community, and it is one of many
            holy wars in the profession. Since the beginning, with jQuery, followed by AngularJS to modern frameworks,
            the war has been fierce. Many has fallen in the path, like Backbone or Sencha, leaving corpses: tons of
            legacy code that has to
            maintained. Others survive, like jQuery, that surprisingly still have a large community. Others, like
            Angular, does not seem to lift off as expected or promised.

            It is already in LTS mode, and it has been retired in favor of its big brother. There is no doubt that it
            was a great leap forward in the framework ecosystem, and some of us still miss it.</p>
